# 🚧 Challenges Faced
During the development of this website, I encountered several challenges that helped me grow as a developer:
Implementing Sound Effects: Integrating audio for real-time feedback required managing different event triggers for correct and incorrect answers. I learned how to optimize the audio files for faster loading times. Responsive Design: Ensuring a seamless experience across various devices was tricky, especially with maintaining layout consistency. This pushed me to deepen my understanding of responsive CSS techniques. Organizing Quiz Logic: Structuring JavaScript code for each section while ensuring reusability and modularity was challenging. This project taught me the importance of clean code organization and function reusability. Error Handling: Unexpected issues, like missed answers and incorrect score calculations, helped me refine my debugging and testing skills.

# 🌱 Lessons Learned
This project taught me valuable skills that will benefit future projects:

Enhanced Problem-Solving: Facing issues during development pushed me to find creative solutions and debug effectively. Importance of User Experience: I learned how to make a website not only functional but enjoyable, with sound effects, intuitive design, and instant feedback. Responsive Design Mastery: Creating a fully responsive site deepened my CSS knowledge, especially in media queries and flexible layouts. Effective Code Organization: Organizing JavaScript effectively taught me about modular code structure and reusability.
